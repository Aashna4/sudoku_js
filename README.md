Basic implementation of sudoku game with hardcoded input and solution. 
Basic features implemented just enough to play the game and reach the correct solution.
Calcultes the total number of errors. 

Plan on implementing more features like - 
1) Dispalying the soltion 
2) Writing a logic to find a solution to any sudoku game 
3) If a digit is completed, remove it from the number list 
4) Load new games
